    <string name="AboutCyclotron">Strength doesn’t come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will. True to Gandhiji’s words, the K! logo bears the cyclotron, which symbolizes the spirit of engineering and innovation. Lawrence was awarded Nobel prize in 1939, for his discovery of a particle accelerator, cyclotron, in which charged particles were generated at a central source and accelerated spirally outward. Every particle of the human body is a symbol of universal existence, and it is our abilities that need to be accelerated, to reveal our wisdom.</string>
